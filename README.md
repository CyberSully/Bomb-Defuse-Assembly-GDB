# Bomb-Defuse-Assembly-GDB

This repository documents the GDB lab focused on analyzing and exploiting a buffer overflow vulnerability in a binary program. The lab was divided into several phases, each requiring the user to step through the program using GDB to identify the root cause of the vulnerability. The challenge was structured as a "bomb" program, where each phase involved different techniques such as memory analysis, breakpoint management, and assembly code inspection. 

Throughout the lab, the analysis was conducted within a VM environment running Kali Linux, with tools like GDB, TUI mode, and assembly debugging used to carefully inspect the binary. The repository includes resources such as the GDB logs, and a comprehensive walkthrough of the debugging process for each phase. This lab served as a hands-on experience in identifying and exploiting stack-based vulnerabilities while becoming proficient in GDB debugging techniques inside a Kali VM hosted on vSphere.
